## 🚀 Quick Start

**Complete bot setup — from Discord Developer Portal to first message in-game.**

---

### Step 1 — Create the Discord bot

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and click **New Application**.
2. Give it a name (e.g. `MyServerBot`), then open the **Bot** tab.
3. Click **Reset Token**, copy the token, and paste it into `MainConfig.xml`:
   ```xml
   <BotToken>PASTE_TOKEN_HERE</BotToken>
   ```
4. On the same Bot tab, scroll down to **Privileged Gateway Intents** and enable **both**:
   - ✅ **Server Members Intent**
   - ✅ **Message Content Intent**

   > Without both intents the bot will connect and then immediately disconnect with a WebSocket error.

---

### Step 2 — Invite the bot to your Discord server

1. In the Developer Portal, go to **OAuth2 → URL Generator**.
2. Under **Scopes**, tick `bot`.
3. Under **Bot Permissions**, tick at minimum:
   - `Send Messages`
   - `Read Message History`
   - `Manage Roles`
   - `Manage Channels`
4. Copy the generated URL, open it in a browser, and invite the bot to your server.

---

### Step 3 — Get your IDs

Enable **Developer Mode** in Discord: *Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode*.
Then right-click any server, channel, or role and select **Copy ID**.

You need at minimum:

| What | Where to find it | Config field |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Discord Server ID | Right-click your server name → Copy ID | `Discord.GuildID` |
| Global chat channel | Right-click the channel → Copy ID | `Discord.ChatChannelId` |

Optional but recommended:

| What | Config field |
| :--- | :--- |
| Admin alert channel | `Discord.AdminAlertChannelId` |
| Remote admin command channel | `Discord.AdminBotChannelId` |
| SimSpeed display channel | `Discord.SimSpeedChannelId` |
| Player count display channel | `Discord.PlayerCountChannelId` |

---

### Step 4 — Configure `MainConfig.xml`

Minimum working configuration:

```xml
<Discord>
  <BotToken>YOUR_BOT_TOKEN</BotToken>
  <GuildID>YOUR_SERVER_ID</GuildID>
  <ChatChannelId>YOUR_CHAT_CHANNEL_ID</ChatChannelId>
</Discord>

<Chat>
  <Enabled>true</Enabled>
  <ServerToDiscord>true</ServerToDiscord>  <!-- game → Discord -->
  <BotToGame>true</BotToGame>              <!-- Discord → game -->
</Chat>
```

Everything else defaults to `0` (disabled) and can be enabled later.

---

### Step 5 — Start Torch

The bot runs **embedded inside Torch** — no separate hosting is needed.
On server start, check the Torch log for these lines to confirm everything is working:

```
[SUCCESS] [DISCORD_BOT] Bot connection established
[SUCCESS] [DISCORD_BOT] Bot is ready and listening!
[SUCCESS] All services initialized
```

If you see repeated reconnection attempts, check that **both** Privileged Intents are enabled (Step 1) and that `GuildID` is not `0`.

---

### Step 6 — Test it

| Test | How |
| :--- | :--- |
| Bot online | Should appear as online in your Discord server member list |
| Server → Discord | Type anything in-game global chat → should appear in your Discord channel |
| Discord → Game | Post a message in your Discord chat channel → should appear in-game as `[Discord] Name: message` |
| Admin alerts | Server start/stop messages should appear in `AdminAlertChannelId` |
| In-game commands | Type `/tds help` in-game — you should see the help text appear as a private message |

---

### Hot-reload

Any time you change `MainConfig.xml` while the server is running, apply it without restarting:
- **In-game:** `/tds reload`
- **From Discord:** `!tds reload` (in the `AdminBotChannelId` channel)

---

## 💬 Smart Chat Relay

Bi-directional chat bridge between the SE server and a configured Discord channel.

- **Loop protection** — messages injected by the plugin (`TDS`, `Discord`, `Server` author tags) are detected and dropped before they can re-enter Discord.
- **Privacy filters** — private whispers and internal faction chat are *never* forwarded to the global channel.
- **Bi-directional** — Discord users can post messages that are broadcast in-game under the `[Discord]` prefix.
- **Rate limiting** — duplicate messages and rapid-fire spam are throttled (configurable delay, default 500 ms).
- **Text sanitisation** — strips control characters and truncates oversized messages before forwarding.

---

## 🔒 Secure Faction Chat

Private, isolated communication channels between SE faction chat and Discord.

- Each faction gets a dedicated Discord text channel inside its own Discord category.
- Messages typed in the SE faction chat are forwarded only to the matching Discord channel — never to the global channel.
- Messages posted in the Discord faction channel are delivered as private in-game messages to all online faction members.
- **GameFactionChatId mapping** — on first sight the channel ID is persisted for instant lookup on all subsequent messages.

---

## 🏴 Faction Synchronisation

Automatically mirrors Space Engineers factions into Discord.

- Creates a Discord **role** and a set of **channels** (text + voice + optional forum) per faction.
- Assigns/removes roles from Discord members as players join or leave factions in-game.
- **Duplicate prevention** — checks for existing roles/channels by name before creating to survive plugin restarts cleanly.
- **Undo / rollback** — `admin:sync:undo <tag>` and `admin:sync:undo_all` remove all Discord artefacts created for a faction and revert the database record.
- **Cleanup** — `admin:sync:cleanup` removes orphaned Discord roles/channels that no longer correspond to any known faction.
- **Cooldown guard** — a 10-second post-undo cooldown prevents a sync from running while Discord's internal cache still shows deleted items.

---

## 🎯 Advanced Death Analysis

Sophisticated, multi-layer system to determine the exact cause and context of every player death.

### Killer Detection

| Scenario | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- |
| Direct PvP | Killer name + weapon grid |
| Turret kill | Traces back to the grid owner, even when offline |
| Collision | Grid-collision victim detected from damage source |
| Environmental (fall, asphyxiation, low-pressure) | Classifies by `MyDamageType` |
| NPC / Space Pirates | Identified by faction tag |
| Self-inflicted | Detected and labelled separately |

### Damage Tracking

- Hooks directly into SE's `IMyDamageSystem.DamageHandler` event.
- Maintains a rolling in-memory buffer of recent damage events per player.
- Resolves the *real* cause of death when the native death event contains ambiguous data.

### Death Message Templates

Fully configurable templates in `DeathMessages.xml`. Four named placeholders are available:

| Placeholder | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `{killer}` | Name of the killer (player, NPC, or grid) |
| `{victim}` | Name of the dead player |
| `{weapon}` | Weapon or damage source label |
| `{location}` | Classified location string (appended automatically) |

**Example templates and their output:**

```
PvP:         "{killer} showed {victim} no mercy with {weapon}"
→ 🔥 orko showed mamba no mercy with Elite Automatic Rifle on the surface of Mars

Turret:      "{victim} walked into {killer}'s {weapon}"
→ ⚡ mamba walked into Space Pirates's Interior Turret at the edge of known space

Environment: "{victim} discovered that space has no oxygen"
→ 💀 mamba discovered that space has no oxygen in the darkness
```

The location text is appended automatically — exact coordinates are never shown. Discord messages receive the same text with a random emote prefix from `DeathMessageEmotes`.

---

## 🌍 Player & Death Location

Dynamic, runtime-computed location classification — no hardcoded planet coordinates.

1. All planets in the world are detected at runtime (vanilla and modded).
2. The player's death position is compared against every planet's radius.
3. The nearest planet is selected and its surface/orbit zones are computed dynamically.

| Zone | Condition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Surface** | Within planet atmosphere radius |
| **Low Orbit** | Just above atmosphere |
| **High Orbit** | Outer orbital band |
| **Inner Space** | Within config-defined inner threshold |
| **Outer Space** | Within config-defined outer threshold |
| **Deep Space** | Beyond all thresholds |

Death history is persisted per-player and used to detect kill streaks and retaliation scenarios.

---

## 🛡️ Server Health Monitoring

Continuous background monitoring via a configurable timer.

- **SimSpeed Watchdog** — if simulation speed drops below the configured threshold, an alert is posted to the admin channel. A cooldown (default 20 min) prevents spam.
- **Player Count** — a Discord voice channel name is updated to reflect the current number of online players.
- **Server lifecycle alerts** — start, stop, restart, and crash events are posted to the admin channel.
- **Startup grace** — no SimSpeed alerts are fired during the initial startup phase to avoid false positives.

---

## ⚙️ Discord Admin Commands

A dedicated Discord channel acts as a remote admin console. Post `!tds <subcommand>` in the configured admin bot channel to execute any admin command without logging into the game.

**Flow:** channel + author validation → `⚙️ Executing…` acknowledgement → command execution → result embed.

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `!tds admin:sync:check` | Check sync status of all factions |
| `!tds admin:sync:undo <tag>` | Undo sync for a specific faction |
| `!tds admin:sync:undo_all` | Undo all faction syncs |
| `!tds admin:sync:cleanup` | Remove orphaned Discord items |
| `!tds admin:sync:status` | Summary of current sync state |
| `!tds admin:verify:list` | List all verified players |
| `!tds admin:verify:pending` | List pending verifications |
| `!tds admin:verify:delete <steamid>` | Delete a verification record |
| `!tds reload` | Reload plugin configuration |
| `!tds status` | Show plugin status |

---

## ✅ Player Verification System

Securely links a Space Engineers SteamID to a Discord UserID via a one-time code exchange.

**Flow:**

1. Player types `/tds verify @DiscordUsername` (or Discord UserID) in-game.
2. Plugin looks up the Discord user, generates an 8-character random code, stores it with an expiry timestamp, and sends it as a Discord DM.
3. Player opens the Discord DM and replies `!verify <CODE>` to the bot.
4. Bot validates the code, marks the player as verified, and assigns the configured Discord role.

| State | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Not verified | No pending or completed record exists |
| Pending | Code generated, awaiting Discord reply |
| Expired | Code past expiry window (configurable, default 15 min) |
| Verified | SteamID ↔ DiscordID link confirmed |

---

## 💾 Data Storage

### XML (default)

Zero external dependencies. Separate XML files per data type (factions, players, verifications, events).

### SQLite (opt-in)

Enable with `<UseSQLite>true</UseSQLite>` in the `DataStorage` section of your config.

> **⚠️ Critical installation note:** `System.Data.SQLite.dll` is a mixed-mode assembly and must **not** be placed in the plugin folder. Place it in the **Torch server root** (where `Torch.Server.exe` lives).

**Download (verified bundle — single DLL, no `x64` folder needed):**
- Release page: https://github.com/mamba73/mamba.TorchDiscordSync/releases/tag/v2.4.47
- Direct: https://github.com/mamba73/mamba.TorchDiscordSync/releases/download/v2.4.47/System.Data.SQLite_v1.0.118.zip

**Installation:**
1. Shut down Torch.
2. Copy `System.Data.SQLite.dll` from the ZIP into the Torch root folder.
3. Restart Torch.

If the DLL is absent, the plugin falls back to XML silently — the server will not crash.

---

## 📋 Event Logging

Structured log entries are written to the local database and optionally to a Discord staff log channel (`Discord.StaffLog` channel ID).

Logged event types include: `VerificationAttempt`, `VerificationDeleted`, `UnverifyCommand`, `AdminCommand`, `CommandError`, and more.

---

Notify faction members via Discord DM/ping when their base takes damage while they are offline.

### Leaderboards & Statistics
Weekly and monthly PvP rankings: K/D ratios, Most Active Faction, Top Ace Pilot, kill streak records.

### Bounty / Retaliation System
Players place bounties on others, tracked in the database and announced on Discord.

### Discord-Driven Economy Readout
Display live in-game economy data (credits, contracts, market prices) via the Discord admin console.

### Scheduled Server Announcements
Configurable recurring Discord embeds (rules, event notices, maintenance windows) on a CRON-like schedule.

### Faction War & Territory Tracking
Detect sustained PvP between faction grids and post live "War Status" updates to Discord.

### Web Dashboard *(long-term)*
Lightweight read-only web panel fed by SQLite: live stats, faction standings, kill history, verification status.

### Multi-Server Support
Route one Discord bot across multiple Torch instances with per-server channel configuration.
